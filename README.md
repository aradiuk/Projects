UNIT Factory projects

Those are my first projects made after UNIT Factory accepted me as their student.

First project "libft": our task was to rewrite a lot of standard functions to get a deeper understanding of their work and where      something can go wrong. We are still using OUR library, not the standard one, to complete our projects. You can see function names inside "libft" folder. To compile a library just write "make".

Second projects "FdF": this project is about creating a simplified 3D graphic representation of a relief landscape. This was our first project to work with a graphic library, called "minilibX". In this project we discovered the basics of graphic programming, and in particular how to place points in space, how to join them with segments and most importantly how to observe the scene from a particular viewpoint. You can see more detail about the project in the file called "fdf.en.fdf". There may be some problems on Linux with the graphic library used here.

Third project "Fractol": this project is meant to create graphically beautiful fractals. Using forked processes and multiple threads I was able to create a fractal, which can display a lot of fractals at the same time and relatively fast zoom in/out (using mouse wheel), increase/decrease number of interations (+/- on NumPad), move (using arrows), change colours (space) and a special "LSD" mode (using L key, USE WITH CAUTION!. I'm just joking). Hope you will enjoy it!
